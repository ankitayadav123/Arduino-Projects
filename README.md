##Hand Gesture Control of Computer using arduino

In this project, I have implemented a simple Arduino based hand gesture control where one can control few functions of the web browser like switching between tabs, scrolling up and down in web pages, controlling various games, PowerPoint presentations, shift between tasks (applications), play or pause a video and increase or decrease the volume (in VLC Player) with the help of hand gestures.
